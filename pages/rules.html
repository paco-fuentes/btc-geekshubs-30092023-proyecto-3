            Mastermind: Basic Game Rules

            Objective of the Game:

            The goal of Mastermind is for the "codemaker" to select a hidden color combination, and the "codebreaker" to
            try and guess that combination within a limited number of attempts.
            Initial Setup:

            The codemaker chooses a secret combination of colors.
            The combination can consist of multiple different colors, and colors may be repeated.
            Available Colors:

            The colors that can be chosen for the combination are typically part of a predefined set, such as red,
            green, blue, yellow, white, and black, among others.
            Codebreaker's Attempts:

            The codebreaker makes an initial guess at the combination.
            The codemaker provides feedback on the guess.
            Feedback:

            Two different colored pegs are usually used to provide feedback.
            One color indicates if a color is in the combination and in the correct position (correct placement).
            Another color indicates if a color is in the combination but in an incorrect position (incorrect placement).
            Iteration:

            The codebreaker makes successive guesses based on the feedback received.
            The number of attempts is often limited (e.g., 10 attempts).
            End of the Game:

            The game ends when the codebreaker correctly guesses the combination or exhausts the available attempts.
            Scoring:

            Performance is evaluated based on the number of attempts used to guess the combination.
            Variations:

            There may be variations in the rules depending on versions or preferences, such as the introduction of
            wildcards, additional constraints, or the option to play in teams.
            Fair Play:

            It's important for both parties to play fairly and abide by the agreed-upon rules.
