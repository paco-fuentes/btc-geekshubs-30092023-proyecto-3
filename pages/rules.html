            Ms. Mind has hacked you and has control of your internet browser, your data, and your bank account!

            Decode the color combination and become a true code breaker.

            You will have a limited number of chances to input your keygen crack and check your code to recover your
            savings.

            If you guess the color and position of a color correctly, a white circle will indicate that it's correct. If
            you only guess the color, then a black circle. However, you won't know which color in your code is right or
            wrong; you'll have to figure that out by comparing the patterns of the rows played.

            You'll have to do it quickly because your bank account is draining, and if it reaches zero... you've lost.
            You'll lose your identity and your money.

            Ms. Mind wants you... she wants to steal from all of you who don't succeed.

            Good luck and kisses to all!
